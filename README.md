- See today's mood, feelings, reflection, and sleep, once logged
- See a relevant mood quote based on today's mood (found in the `data.json` file)
- See a graph showing the most recent eleven records to identify mood and sleep trends
- Interact with each bar on the mood and sleep trends chart to see all information about that day
- See their average mood and sleep from the past five check-ins and see how they compare with the previous five
- Update their name or avatar through settings
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
